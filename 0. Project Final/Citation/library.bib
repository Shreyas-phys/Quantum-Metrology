   abstract = {Around the globe several observatories are seeking the first direct detection
of gravitational waves (GWs). These waves are predicted by Einstein's General
Theory of Relativity [Einstein, A., Annalen der Physik 49, 769-822 (1916)] and
are generated e.g. by black-hole binary systems [Sathyaprakash, B. S. and
Schutz, B. F., Living Rev. Relativity 12, 2 (2009)]. Current GW detectors are
Michelson-type kilometer-scale laser interferometers measuring the distance
changes between in vacuum suspended mirrors. The sensitivity of these detectors
at frequencies above several hundred hertz is limited by the vacuum
(zero-point) fluctuations of the electromagnetic field. A quantum technology -
the injection of squeezed light [Caves, C. M., Phys. Rev. D 23, 1693-1708
(1981)] - offers a solution to this problem. Here we demonstrate the
squeezed-light enhancement of GEO600, which will be the GW observatory operated
by the LIGO Scientific Collaboration in its search for GWs for the next 3-4
years. GEO600 now operates with its best ever sensitivity, which proves the
usefulness of quantum entanglement and the qualification of squeezed light as a
key technology for future GW astronomy.},

It has been shown recently that the Fisher information for a linear two-mode interferometer cannot exceed the number of particles if the input state is separable. As a direct consequence, with such input states the shot-noise limit is the ultimate limit of precision. In this work, we go a step further by deducing bounds on F for several multiparticle entanglement classes. These bounds imply that genuine multiparticle entanglement is needed for reaching the highest sensitivities in quantum interferometry. We further compute similar bounds on the average Fisher information F̄ for collective spin operators, where the average is performed over all possible spin directions. We show that these criteria detect different sets of states and illustrate their strengths by considering several examples, also using experimental data. In particular, the criterion based on F̄ is able to detect certain bound entangled states. © 2012 American Physical Society.},

   abstract = {All our former experience with application of quantum theory seems to say that what is predicted by quantum formalism must occur in the laboratory. But the essence of quantum formalism-entanglement, recognized by Einstein, Podolsky, Rosen, and Schrödinger-waited over 70 years to enter laboratories as a new resource as real as energy. This holistic property of compound quantum systems, which involves nonclassical correlations between subsystems, has potential for many quantum processes, including canonical ones: quantum cryptography, quantum teleportation, and dense coding. However, it appears that this new resource is complex and difficult to detect. Although it is usually fragile to the environment, it is robust against conceptual and mathematical tools, the task of which is to decipher its rich structure. This article reviews basic aspects of entanglement including its characterization, detection, distillation, and quantification. In particular, various manifestations of entanglement via Bell inequalities, entropic inequalities, entanglement witnesses, and quantum cryptography are discussed, and some interrelations are pointed out. The basic role of entanglement in quantum communication within a distant laboratory paradigm is stressed, and some peculiarities such as the irreversibility of entanglement manipulations are also discussed including its extremal form-the bound entanglement phenomenon. The basic role of entanglement witnesses in detection of entanglement is emphasized. © 2009 The American Physical Society.},

   abstract = {Quantum metrology provides a route to overcome practical limits in sensing devices. It holds particular relevance to biology, where sensitivity and resolution constraints restrict applications both in fundamental biophysics and in medicine. Here, we review quantum metrology from this biological context, focusing on optical techniques due to their particular relevance for biological imaging, sensing, and stimulation. Our understanding of quantum mechanics has already enabled important applications in biology, including positron emission tomography (PET) with entangled photons, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using nuclear magnetic resonance, and bio-magnetic imaging with superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs). In quantum metrology an even greater range of applications arise from the ability to not just understand, but to engineer, coherence and correlations at the quantum level. In the past few years, quite dramatic progress has been seen in applying these ideas into biological systems. Capabilities that have been demonstrated include enhanced sensitivity and resolution, immunity to imaging artefacts and technical noise, and characterization of the biological response to light at the single-photon level. New quantum measurement techniques offer even greater promise, raising the prospect for improved multi-photon microscopy and magnetic imaging, among many other possible applications. Realization of this potential will require cross-disciplinary input from researchers in both biology and quantum physics. In this review we seek to communicate the developments of quantum metrology in a way that is accessible to biologists and biophysicists, while providing sufficient details to allow the interested reader to obtain a solid understanding of the field. We further seek to introduce quantum physicists to some of the central challenges of optical measurements in biological science. We hope that this will aid in bridging the communication gap that exists between the fields, and thereby guide the future development of this multidisciplinary research area.},

Assuming a flat prior phase probability distribution and no photon loss, quasi-Gaussian states and N00N states are shown to be optimal when the prior phase interval ∆ is large and small, respectively, for a single measurement. The quasi-Gaussian states reduce to an exact Gaussian form in the limit of large N. A third class of optimal input states exists for intermediate values of ∆. The effects of photon loss on the optimal states and the measurement precision are then studied. Finally, optimal states are shown to be stable when other symmetric prior phase probability distributions are used, which suggests a possible method to determine optimal input states for a sequence of measurements.},

In practice, however, entangled states are often more prone to decoherence, which may prevent reaching this performance.

The development of the latter was enabled by the emergence of single-photon-sensitive cameras that are able to characterize spatial correlations and high-dimensional entanglement. Thereby, new techniques emerged, such as ghost imaging of objects — in which the quantum correlations between photons reveal the image from photons that have never interacted with the object — or imaging with undetected photons by using nonlinear interferometers. In addition, quantum approaches in imaging can also lead to an improvement in the performance of conventional imaging systems. These improvements can be obtained by means of image contrast, resolution enhancement that exceeds the classical limit and acquisition of sub-shot-noise phase or amplitude images. In this Review, we discuss the application of quantum states of light for advanced imaging techniques. Using quantum states of light for imaging both reveals quantum phenomena and enables new protocols that result in images that surpass classical limitations. Such systems require both quantum light sources and often the ingenious use of detector technologies.},

This compares well to S= (2/27) 2 /2, obtainable by combining two CNOT gates and a passive quantum filter. The general optimization approach can easily be applied to other areas of interest, such as quantum error correction, cryptography, and metrology. © 2009 The American Physical Society.},

   abstract = {Nonclassical states of light find applications in enhancing the performance of optical interferometric experiments, with notable example of gravitational-wave detectors. Still, the presence of decoherence hinders significantly the performance of quantum-enhanced protocols. In this review, we summarize the developments of quantum metrology with particular focus on optical interferometry and derive fundamental bounds on achievable quantum-enhanced precision in optical interferometry taking into account the most relevant decoherence processes including: phase diffusion, losses, and imperfect interferometric visibility. We introduce all the necessary tools of quantum optics as well as quantum estimation theory required to derive the bounds. We also discuss the practical attainability of the bounds derived and stress, in particular, that the techniques of quantum-enhanced interferometry which are being implemented in modern gravitational-wave detectors are close to the optimal ones.},

@article{GPCS,
   abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-α-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 Å for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

Both the SU(2) and SU(1,1) interferometers can in principle achieve a phase sensitivity approaching 1/N, where N is the total number of quanta entering the interferometer, provided that the light entering the input ports is prepared in a suitable quantum state.

@article{rosetta,
   abstract = {Heisenberg-limited measurement protocols can be used to gain an increase in measurement precision over classical protocols. Such measurements can be implemented using, e.g., optical Mach-Zehnder interferometers and Ramsey spectroscopes. We address the formal equivalence between the Mach-Zehnder interferometer, the Ramsey spectroscope, and the discrete Fourier transform. Based on this equivalence we introduce the ``quantum Rosetta stone'', and we describe a projective-measurement scheme for generating the desired correlations between the interferometric input states in order to achieve Heisenberg-limited sensitivity. The Rosetta stone then tells us the same method should work in atom spectroscopy.},

   abstract = {We optimize two-mode entangled number states of light in the presence of loss in order to maximize the extraction of the available phase information in an interferometer. Our approach optimizes over the entire available input Hilbert space with no constraints, other than fixed total initial photon number. We optimize to maximize the Fisher information, which is equivalent to minimizing the phase uncertainty. We find that in the limit of zero loss, the optimal state is the maximally path-entangled (so-called N00N) state, for small loss, the optimal state gradually deviates from the N00N state, and in the limit of large loss, the optimal state converges to a generalized two-mode coherent state, with a finite total number of photons. The results provide a general protocol for optimizing the performance of a quantum optical interferometer in the presence of photon loss, with applications to quantum imaging, metrology, sensing, and information processing. © 2009 The American Physical Society.},

Optimal phase measurements, given ideal input states, reveal an asymptotic 1/n decrease in phase uncertainty Δθ for n the mean photon number of the input state. In contradistinction to previous schemes for realizing the number-phase uncertainty limit, the 1/n limit achieved here is independent of the interferometer phase shift; prior information about the expected phase shift is not necessary to attain this limit.

   abstract = {Nonclassical states of light find applications in enhancing the performance of optical interferometric experiments, with notable example of gravitational-wave detectors. Still, the presence of decoherence hinders significantly the performance of quantum-enhanced protocols. In this review, we summarize the developments of quantum metrology with particular focus on optical interferometry and derive fundamental bounds on achievable quantum-enhanced precision in optical interferometry taking into account the most relevant decoherence processes including: phase diffusion, losses, and imperfect interferometric visibility. We introduce all the necessary tools of quantum optics as well as quantum estimation theory required to derive the bounds. We also discuss the practical attainability of the bounds derived and stress, in particular, that the techniques of quantum-enhanced interferometry which are being implemented in modern gravitational-wave detectors are close to the optimal ones.},

For the two-qubit controlled-sign [or controlled NOT (CNOT)] gate, we provide numerical evidence that the maximum success rate is S=2/27 using two unentangled ancilla resources; interestingly, additional ancilla resources do not increase the success rate. For the three-qubit Toffoli gate, we show that perfect fidelity is obtained with only three unentangled ancilla photons-less than in any existing scheme-with a maximum S=0.00340. This compares well to S= (2/27) 2 /2, obtainable by combining two CNOT gates and a passive quantum filter. The general optimization approach can easily be applied to other areas of interest, such as quantum error correction, cryptography, and metrology. © 2009 The American Physical Society.},

We optimize to maximize the Fisher information, which is equivalent to minimizing the phase uncertainty. We find that in the limit of zero loss, the optimal state is the maximally path-entangled (so-called N00N) state, for small loss, the optimal state gradually deviates from the N00N state, and in the limit of large loss, the optimal state converges to a generalized two-mode coherent state, with a finite total number of photons.

   abstract = {The production of pairs of entangled photons simply by focusing a laser beam onto a crystal with a nonlinear optical response was used to test quantum mechanics and to open new approaches in imaging. The development of the latter was enabled by the emergence of single-photon-sensitive cameras that are able to characterize spatial correlations and high-dimensional entanglement. Thereby, new techniques emerged, such as ghost imaging of objects — in which the quantum correlations between photons reveal the image from photons that have never interacted with the object — or imaging with undetected photons by using nonlinear interferometers. In addition, quantum approaches in imaging can also lead to an improvement in the performance of conventional imaging systems. These improvements can be obtained by means of image contrast, resolution enhancement that exceeds the classical limit and acquisition of sub-shot-noise phase or amplitude images. In this Review, we discuss the application of quantum states of light for advanced imaging techniques. Using quantum states of light for imaging both reveals quantum phenomena and enables new protocols that result in images that surpass classical limitations. Such systems require both quantum light sources and often the ingenious use of detector technologies.},

To reduce this noise it has been suggested to use entangled atomic ensembles with reduced atomic noise. Potentially this can push the stability all the way to the limit allowed by the Heisenberg uncertainty relation, which is denoted the Heisenberg limit. In practice, however, entangled states are often more prone to decoherence, which may prevent reaching this performance. Here we present an adaptive measurement protocol that in the presence of a realistic source of decoherence enables us to get near-Heisenberg-limited stability of atomic clocks using entangled atoms.

Assuming a flat prior phase probability distribution and no photon loss, quasi-Gaussian states and N00N states are shown to be optimal when the prior phase interval ∆ is large and small, respectively, for a single measurement. The quasi-Gaussian states reduce to an exact Gaussian form in the limit of large N. A third class of optimal input states exists for intermediate values of ∆. The effects of photon loss on the optimal states and the measurement precision are then studied.

It holds particular relevance to biology, where sensitivity and resolution constraints restrict applications both in fundamental biophysics and in medicine. Here, we review quantum metrology from this biological context, focusing on optical techniques due to their particular relevance for biological imaging, sensing, and stimulation. Our understanding of quantum mechanics has already enabled important applications in biology, including positron emission tomography (PET) with entangled photons, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using nuclear magnetic resonance, and bio-magnetic imaging with superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs). In quantum metrology an even greater range of applications arise from the ability to not just understand, but to engineer, coherence and correlations at the quantum level. In the past few years, quite dramatic progress has been seen in applying these ideas into biological systems. Capabilities that have been demonstrated include enhanced sensitivity and resolution, immunity to imaging artefacts and technical noise, and characterization of the biological response to light at the single-photon level. New quantum measurement techniques offer even greater promise, raising the prospect for improved multi-photon microscopy and magnetic imaging, among many other possible applications. Realization of this potential will require cross-disciplinary input from researchers in both biology and quantum physics. In this review we seek to communicate the developments of quantum metrology in a way that is accessible to biologists and biophysicists, while providing sufficient details to allow the interested reader to obtain a solid understanding of the field. We further seek to introduce quantum physicists to some of the central challenges of optical measurements in biological science. We hope that this will aid in bridging the communication gap that exists between the fields, and thereby guide the future development of this multidisciplinary research area.},

But the essence of quantum formalism-entanglement, recognized by Einstein, Podolsky, Rosen, and Schrödinger-waited over 70 years to enter laboratories as a new resource as real as energy. This holistic property of compound quantum systems, which involves nonclassical correlations between subsystems, has potential for many quantum processes, including canonical ones: quantum cryptography, quantum teleportation, and dense coding. However, it appears that this new resource is complex and difficult to detect. Although it is usually fragile to the environment, it is robust against conceptual and mathematical tools, the task of which is to decipher its rich structure. This article reviews basic aspects of entanglement including its characterization, detection, distillation, and quantification. In particular, various manifestations of entanglement via Bell inequalities, entropic inequalities, entanglement witnesses, and quantum cryptography are discussed, and some interrelations are pointed out. The basic role of entanglement in quantum communication within a distant laboratory paradigm is stressed, and some peculiarities such as the irreversibility of entanglement manipulations are also discussed including its extremal form-the bound entanglement phenomenon. The basic role of entanglement witnesses in detection of entanglement is emphasized. © 2009 The American Physical Society.},

   abstract = {The Fisher information F gives a limit to the ultimate precision achievable in a phase estimation protocol. It has been shown recently that the Fisher information for a linear two-mode interferometer cannot exceed the number of particles if the input state is separable. As a direct consequence, with such input states the shot-noise limit is the ultimate limit of precision. In this work, we go a step further by deducing bounds on F for several multiparticle entanglement classes. These bounds imply that genuine multiparticle entanglement is needed for reaching the highest sensitivities in quantum interferometry. We further compute similar bounds on the average Fisher information F̄ for collective spin operators, where the average is performed over all possible spin directions. We show that these criteria detect different sets of states and illustrate their strengths by considering several examples, also using experimental data. In particular, the criterion based on F̄ is able to detect certain bound entangled states. © 2012 American Physical Society.},

   abstract = {Quantum information theory is applied to practical interferometer-based phase measurements to deduce the optimal phase measurement scheme with two optical modes. Optimal phase measurements, given ideal input states, reveal an asymptotic 1/n decrease in phase uncertainty 50 for n the mean photon number of the input state. In contradistinction to previous schemes for realizing the number-phase uncertainty limit, the 1/n limit achieved here is independent of the interferometer phase shift; prior information about the expected phase shift is not necessary to attain this limit. These results apply more generally to su(2) and so(3) phase parameter estimation. PACS numbers: 42.50.Dv, 42.50.Lc The precise determination of phase shifts is an important issue for quantum measurement theory, both for applications such as gravitational wave detection [1] and because phase measurement sensitivity is fundamentally limited by the complementarity between photon number and phase [2]. In practice, phase difference measurements are performed using interferometers and optimizing the phase estimation has focused on adopting the ideal input states [3,4]; a photon number difference measurement of the two output fields from the interferometer yields an asymptotic 1/n decrease in phase uncertainty 50 for par ticular values of the phase shift. Here we determine the optimal phase measurement scheme for two optical modes [4,5] in arbitrary input states, using quantum parameter estimation theory [6-8]. We determine the phase uncertainty 59 for ideal input states (mean photon number n) which reveals 1/n decrease for large n; this uncertainty is independent of the choice of phase shift and is therefore the ideal measurement which corresponds to interferomet-ric phase shift measurements at the Heisenberg uncertainty limit. We introduce a scheme which might be realized using a Mach-Zehnder interferometer and a suitable two-mode input state. The two input modes are mixed at a beam splitter and propagate along (possibly distinct) optical paths to a fInal mixing beam splitter which produces the two output modes. All measurements are performed on the output modes, and we identify the particular joint observable on the output modes which yields an optimal determination of differential phase shifts between the two paths of the interferometer. The two annihilation operators for the two input modes into an interferometer are designated a and b, respectively. Using the Schwinger representation [3,9] Jx = (atb + abt)/2, J& = (atb-abt)/2i (ata + btb)/2 J J + J + J~ (1) it follows that the common eigenstate of J, and J is the two-mode Fock state I Jp), = lj + p). Ij-p)b (2) with eigenvalues p, and j(j + 1), respectively, where I j + p,), is the Fock number state with j + p, photons entering port a, and I j-p,)b is the Fock state entering port b. Although j ~ p, must be integers, j and p, can both be integers or both be half-odd integers. An arbitrary pure input state can be expressed as oo OO J I+) = g + .Im). ln)b = g m, n=O 2j=O p. =-j (3) where the sum over 2j indicates that the sum includes j both integer and half-odd integer. The 50/50 beam splitter and phase shift operators are given by [3,10] 9~ = exp(~i' J /2), 2 (@) = exp(i@J,), (4) respectively, where the ~ choice is an adjustable phase shift, and we assume that equal and opposite phase shifts exist in each arm of the interferometer. The interferometer transformation is thus given by I(P) = 9 f'(P)B = e-'~' (5) and can be regarded as a device which induces a linear rotation of the input state by an angle P about the J, axis. In this paper we take the perspective of quantum parameter estimation [11]. Our objective is to determine the optimal measurement scheme, specified as a positive operator-valued measure, to estimate the phase shift parameter P. The interferometer matrix elements are given by},

   abstract = {We show how maximally correlated states of N two-level particles can be used in spectroscopy to yield a frequency uncertainty equal to (NT) 1 , where T is the time of a single measurement. From the time-energy uncertainty relation we show that this is the best precision possible. We rephrase these results in the language of particle interferometry and obtain a state and detection operator which can be used to achieve a phase uncertainty exactly equal to the 1/N Heisenberg limit, where N is the number of particles used in the measurement. S1050-29479650712-2 PACS numbers: 42.50.Dv, 06.30.Ft, 03.65.Bz, 39.30.w Quantum limits to noise in spectroscopy 1-4 and inter-ferometry 5-13 have been a subject of fundamental, and to an increasing degree, practical interest. This is especially true for spectroscopy on trapped atoms or ions where the number of particles N is fixed and kept small to reduce undesired perturbations. Naively, the uncertainty of a spectroscopic or interferometric measurement is limited by counting statistics to be inversely proportional to N 1/2. However, a number of proposals have shown that by introducing quantum correlations between the particles, the measurement uncertainty can be reduced so that it scales inversely with N rather than N 1/2 2-13. None of the ideas discussed so far, however, have realized the fundamental limit for quantum noise in the measurement of atomic or interferometric phase, which we show to be precisely equal to 1/N. In the present work we realize this fundamental quantum limit for any N with an approach that examines a different type of correlation and measures a different operator than previously considered. We start by considering the spectroscopy of N two-level particles. In an equivalent spin representation 1,14, let J N/2,M J N/2 denote the state where all the particles are in the ground spin-down state g with energy E g and N/2,N/2 denote the state where all the particles are in the excited spin-up state e with energy E e. We show how the state M N/2,N/2N/2,N/2/ 2 1 can be used to measure 0 (E e E g)/ with a frequency uncertainty equal to (NT) 1 , where T is the time of a single measurement. This state is ''maximally correlated'' in the sense that a measurement of any one atom's energy eigen-state determines the state of all of the others. It is an N-particle version of the two-particle states discussed in the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen experiments 15. The use of M requires measuring a different operator than customary in spectroscopy. We find a measurement operator which yields a 1/NT uncertainty and discuss how this measurement operator and M can be realized with small numbers of trapped ions. Our arguments are phrased in the language of spectroscopy by the Ramsey technique of separated oscillating fields 16. The Ramsey technique is formally equivalent to Mach-Zehnder interferometry 4,6. Therefore, after obtaining our results for optimal frequency measurements, we rephrase them in terms of interferometry. References 2 and 4 discuss the basic idea of using correlated or squeezed spin states to improve the precision in spectroscopy for the Ramsey technique of separated oscillating fields. We briefly review the idea here and start by considering the case of N uncorrelated particles where each particle is initially prepared in its ground state g. The initial state of the composite system for this case is equivalent to the JN/2, M J N/2 state of a JN/2 spin. This initial t0 state has J z 0 N/2, J x 0 J y 0 0, and J x (0)J y (0)N 1/2 /2. Here A t denotes the expectation value of an operator A at time t and A(t) A 2) t 1/2 , where A 2 A 2 A 2 .] The Hamiltonian for the equivalent spin system is H •B , where 0 J is the magnetic moment of the composite system and B is the applied field. Here B B 0 z ˆ B 1 , where B 0 0 / 0 we assume 0 0 and B 1 is an applied field used to perform spectroscopy. We assume that B 1 is perpendicular to and rotates about the z axis according to B 1 B 1 x ˆ sint y ˆ cost]. In the Ramsey technique 16, B 1 is applied is nonzero for two periods of length t /2 /(2 R), where R 0 B 1 / is the Rabi frequency, separated by a period of length T during which B 1 0. It is convenient to describe the Ramsey technique in a frame of reference rotating with B 1. With the assumption R 0 , the first pulse rotates the spin vector about B 1 the y axis in the rotating frame by 90°. The spin vector then precesses about the z axis during the field-free period, acquiring an angle (0)T relative to its initial direction the x axis in the rotating frame. This angle could be read out by measuring, for example, J x in the rotating frame. Experimentally this is done by applying the second /2 pulse, which rotates the spin vector by 90° about the B 1 axis, and then measuring the number of atoms in e. This final measurement is equivalent to measuring J z. We obtain J z t f N/2cos 0 T, 2},
